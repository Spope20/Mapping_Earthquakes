# Mapping_Earthquakes
The goal of this project was to showcase the ability to make API calls using Javascript. Since the project utilizes [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) API the website requires a config.js file with the constant API_KEY set to your own api key. Images have been provided [here](https://github.com/Spope20/Mapping_Earthquakes/tree/main/Images) for viewing sampels of the project without a key.
